An adaptation of the
[MCP Sequential Thinking Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/sequentialthinking/index.ts)
designed to guide tool usage in problem-solving. This server helps
break down complex problems into manageable steps and provides
recommendations for which MCP tools would be most effective at each
stage.

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that combines sequential
thinking with intelligent tool suggestions. For each step in the
problem-solving process, it provides confidence-scored recommendations
for which tools to use, along with rationale for why each tool would
be appropriate.

## Features

- 🤔 Dynamic and reflective problem-solving through sequential
  thoughts
- 🔄 Flexible thinking process that adapts and evolves
- 🌳 Support for branching and revision of thoughts
- 🛠️ Intelligent tool recommendations for each step
- 📊 Confidence scoring for tool suggestions
- 🔍 Detailed rationale for tool recommendations
- 📝 Step tracking with expected outcomes
- 🔄 Progress monitoring with previous and remaining steps
- 🎯 Alternative tool suggestions for each step

## How It Works

This server analyses each step of your thought process and recommends
appropriate MCP tools to help accomplish the task. Each recommendation
includes:

- A confidence score (0-1) indicating how well the tool matches the
  current need
- A clear rationale explaining why the tool would be helpful
- A priority level to suggest tool execution order
- Alternative tools that could also be used

The server works with any MCP tools available in your environment. It
provides recommendations based on the current step's requirements, but
the actual tool execution is handled by the consumer (like Claude).

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how the server guides tool usage:

```json
{
	"thought": "Initial research step to understand what universal reactivity means in Svelte 5",
	"current_step": {
		"step_description": "Gather initial information about Svelte 5's universal reactivity",
		"expected_outcome": "Clear understanding of universal reactivity concept",
		"recommended_tools": [
			{
				"tool_name": "search_docs",
				"confidence": 0.9,
				"rationale": "Search Svelte documentation for official information",
				"priority": 1
			},
			{
				"tool_name": "tavily_search",
				"confidence": 0.8,
				"rationale": "Get additional context from reliable sources",
				"priority": 2
			}
		],
		"next_step_conditions": [
			"Verify information accuracy",
			"Look for implementation details"
		]
	},
	"thought_number": 1,
	"total_thoughts": 5,
	"next_thought_needed": true
}
```

The server tracks your progress and supports:

- Creating branches to explore different approaches
- Revising previous thoughts with new information
- Maintaining context across multiple steps
- Suggesting next steps based on current findings

## Configuration

This server requires configuration through your MCP client. Here are
examples for different environments:

### Cline Configuration

Add this to your Cline MCP settings:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"mcp-sequentialthinking-tools": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "mcp-sequentialthinking-tools"]
		}
	}
}
```

### Claude Desktop with WSL Configuration

For WSL environments, add this to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"mcp-sequentialthinking-tools": {
			"command": "wsl.exe",
			"args": [
				"bash",
				"-c",
				"source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && /home/username/.nvm/versions/node/v20.12.1/bin/npx mcp-sequentialthinking-tools"
			]
		}
	}
}
```

## API

The server implements a single MCP tool with configurable parameters:

### sequentialthinking_tools

A tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts,
with intelligent tool recommendations.

Parameters:

- `thought` (string, required): Your current thinking step
- `next_thought_needed` (boolean, required): Whether another thought
  step is needed
- `thought_number` (integer, required): Current thought number
- `total_thoughts` (integer, required): Estimated total thoughts
  needed
- `is_revision` (boolean, optional): Whether this revises previous
  thinking
- `revises_thought` (integer, optional): Which thought is being
  reconsidered
- `branch_from_thought` (integer, optional): Branching point thought
  number
- `branch_id` (string, optional): Branch identifier
- `needs_more_thoughts` (boolean, optional): If more thoughts are
  needed
- `current_step` (object, optional): Current step recommendation with:
  - `step_description`: What needs to be done
  - `recommended_tools`: Array of tool recommendations with confidence
    scores
  - `expected_outcome`: What to expect from this step
  - `next_step_conditions`: Conditions for next step
- `previous_steps` (array, optional): Steps already recommended
- `remaining_steps` (array, optional): High-level descriptions of
  upcoming steps
